## Getting Started

Welcome to your first steps with the Smoky Hill Dashboard! Here's how you can get started:

1. Get the Files

Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.

2. Open the File

Open the `index.html` file in your favorite text editor or code editor.

3. Customize Your Dashboard

Make the dashboard your own by customizing the following elements if you want to:

- **Favicon**: Replace the `FAVICON URL` in the `<link>` tag.
- **Background Image**: Replace the link for the background image in the CSS styles if you want a diffrent background image.
- **Main Heading**: Change the text inside the `<h1>` tag.
- **Button Links**: Update the `href` attributes in the button links.
- **Optional Logo**: Uncomment and replace the `<img>` tag for a custom logo.
- **Optional Text Card**: Uncomment and customize the text and heading inside the `.text-card` div.

4. Save Your Changes

Don't forget to save your changes!

5. Deploy Your Dashboard

Add the updated files to your web server's document root (e.g., `/var/www/html`). You can then view your new page at your web server's main IP (e.g., `192.168.0.1`) or if you put it in a subdirectory, you can view it at a URL like: `192.168.0.1/dash/index.html`.

And that's it! Enjoy your new, personalized dashboard.
